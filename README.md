# Jeremiah
Arduino code to control a 1lb full body spinner, Jeremiah!
Code originally from https://github.com/swallenhardware/MeltyHalo

## Below is from the original repo's readme:

This Arduino project is the control code for Halo, the beetleweight Battlebot designed by Spencer Allen and Pierce Jensen.

The full writeup for this project can be found at https://www.swallenhardware.io/battlebots/


Current functionality:

-Can communicate with the controller two-way over serial

-Can drive the brushless ESCs

-Can operate as a ram bot with standard arcade controls

-Can receive and debounce IR beacon pulses

-Can measure rotational speed using the accelerometer

-Can translate in spin mode using beacon, accelerometer, and hybrid sensing

-Uses the accelerometer to account for failures in the beacon, and vice-versa.

-Automatically falls back to beacon-only motion if the accelerometer fails, and can be set to accelerometer-only if the beacon becomes unreliable.

-Operates a POV display while in spin mode

-Incorporates safety features such as dead-man switch, loss of comms shutdowns, and a watchdog timer.


TODO:

-Finish support for manual trim adjust
